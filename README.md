###### My favourite food is alfredo penne chicken pasta.

I like this food because it is a mixture of both **veg and non veg** ingredients. It is prepared in a **high temperature** and with an extra added **mayonnaise**. This gives a good flavour to the dish.

## List of places that I would suggest to visit :-
1. Goa
1. Pondicherry
1. Vizag
1. Mumbai

I would like to suggest these places to visit because all these places were coastal regions and all the four places were different from each other. All the four places were the most popular tourism spots in India. Not only the Indians, many foreigners prefer visiting these places.
